Hey! I'm Sophia! Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm super passionate about cybersecurity and how computers work at their core. My journey into tech has been driven by an endless curiosity to understand systems and networks, and over time, I‚Äôve found myself diving deeper into ethical hacking and penetration testing. I absolutely love getting into systems, finding vulnerabilities, and figuring out how to secure them!! (legally, of course). LOL.

I‚Äôm all about keeping data safe and systems locked down, whether it‚Äôs through manual security testing or automating processes with tools I‚Äôve built. Each vulnerability I uncover is like a puzzle to solve‚Äîone that makes the world a bit more secure once it's fixed. I take a lot of pride in using my skills to protect systems and keep attackers out!

When I‚Äôm not testing or hacking systems, I‚Äôm probably nerding out on the latest tech trends or playing around with new tools to sharpen my skills. Kali Linux is my go-to, and I also love working on macOS for some of my projects. Keeping up with the ever-changing tech landscape is part of the fun for me.

Feel free to check out my projects, where I‚Äôve created scripts and tools to make cybersecurity tasks easier and more efficient. Thanks for stopping by, and let‚Äôs keep systems safe together! :)

[![Soph's IDS Script](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Soph's%20ID%20Script-lightgrey)](https://github.com/securesoph/sophsidscript)  
This tool automates identification processes for systems, simplifying the task of gathering user and device information by generating detailed system insights. It‚Äôs designed to make routine tasks for system administrators more efficient and less error-prone. I created this script to save time and make managing systems more straightforward.

[![Soph's Vulnerability Scanner](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Soph's%20Vulnerability%20Scanner-lightgrey)](https://github.com/securesoph/sophsvulnerabilityscanner)  
This script scans systems for vulnerabilities and provides detailed reports on potential security risks. By automating vulnerability detection, it helps users secure their systems before attackers can exploit weaknesses. I built this scanner because I wanted to make security assessments more accessible and automated for everyone.

[![Soph's Password Generator](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Soph's%20Password%20Generator-lightgrey)](https://github.com/securesoph/sophspasswordgenerator)  
A handy tool to generate strong, random passwords, ensuring secure password practices for users. This helps protect sensitive information by creating passwords that are tough to crack. I put this together to help people create secure passwords without the hassle of coming up with one on their own.
